# weather-vue

A simple weather app built with Vue.js utilizing the OpenData API from the Finnish Meteorological Institute
and the OpenWeatherMap API.

This uses the OpenData API as the primary source of weather data,
but the OpenWeatherMap API is used to complement the data when the OpenData API does not have enough data available.

### Weather Icons used in this project
This project uses the [Weather Icons by Bas Milius](https://github.com/basmilius/weather-icons).
The icons are renamed according to the 
[OpenData API's weather icon explanations](https://www.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/latauspalvelun-pikaohje).
